Target at the point of origin [0, 0, 0] --> [x, y, z]
After some measurements, shift of the target to [-0.40, -0.40, 0]
After some measurements, shift of the target to [-1.30, -1.30, 0]

What is visible?
3x Zero Offset calculation. For the position [0, 0, 0] a correction value is determined.
Measurements at [0, 0, 0] are pretty accurate. Nevertheless, the distance measurement is instabile.
As not all distance measurements are accurate, not all positions can be calculated resulting in a "nan" output.
At the middle of the measurement "Console_Output4" it is visible, that the positioning gets very inaccurate.
Neither the distance measurement, not the positioning are correct and have a very high error.
